You will probably need to edit the Makefile to declare
the correct paths to the dependencies.
The following libs are needed to link CurvedSalsa:


curve25519-donna
================
The original curve25519 was written by D. J. Bernstein (http://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html)
The portable version used here is written by Adam Langley and can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/curve25519-donna/

Boost
=====
The Boost C++ Libraries are a collection of open source libraries that extend
the functionality of C++ available at http://www.boost.org/


The used libraries are in the public domain. The same is true for CurvedSalsa.
